Why do we need Xpath and Css Selector?
    1. Developers will not provide all the locators in HTML
    2. By using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is Xpath?
    1. Xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements
        uniquely on the web page.

Types of Xpath:
    1. Absolute Xpath -> starts from the starting node in html
                        it always starts with single slash (/)
                        e.g. /html/body/div/div/div

    2. Relative Xpath -> starts from any node in the html
                         it always starts with double slash (//)

Syntax for relative Xpath:
    //tagname[@attributes = 'attribute value']

Example:
    //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by its text.
    //tagname[text() = 'text value']

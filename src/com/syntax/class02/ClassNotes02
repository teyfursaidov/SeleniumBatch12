Selenium Class 2.
    What is a WebElement?
        1. Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a WebElement.
            e.g. buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, links etc.

HTML:
    HyperText Markup Language

Keyword DOM - Document Object Module
    It is the browser's internal view of the webpage.
    Also called as Developer's tools or Dev Tools.

Document:
    1. Can be stored any document such as pdf, excel.
Object:
    2. Any line in HTML jis considered as Object.
Model:
    3. Is just a layout of the HTML.

Locator:
    1. Is an address or a position of an WebElement of the webpage.
    2. Is used to locate or identify WebElements on the webpage.

8 locators:
    1. ID
    2. Name
    3. TagName
    4. Xpath
    5. LinkText
    6. CSS Selector
    7. PartialLinkText
    8. ClassName

HTML Scripting Meaning:
    1. purple -> tags || button, input, div.
    2. brown -> attributes || name, class, id
    3. blue -> attribute value ||

Why do we need many locators?
    1. Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements.
    2. Some locators may have duplicate values in different notes.
    3. In case of duplicate locators Selenium will use the first input only.
    4. Some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for.
        linkText and partialLinktext are only used for links. "a" tag is also called an anchor tag.

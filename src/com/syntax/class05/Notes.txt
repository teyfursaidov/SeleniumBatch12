DropDowns:
    Dropdown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or
        more options.

Types of DropDowns:
    1. Single select
    2. Multiple select.

Handling dropdowns:
    1. Click on dropdown and click on the option
    2. Using Select class
                in order to use Select class
                we need to make sure our dropdown has
                    select tag


Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
    1. By index
    2. By visible text.
    3. By value.

    Whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them inside the container
        such as List, Set etc.

In order to deselect any option in dropdown;
    Make sure your DD is multiple select
    deselectByValue()
    deselectByVisibleText()
    deselectByIndex()
    deselectAll()
